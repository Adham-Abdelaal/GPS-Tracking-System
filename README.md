# GPS Tracking System using TM4C123G LaunchPad (Tiva C)
This is a GPS tracking system program that uses a TIVA c microcontroller to calculate the total distance from a starting point to any destination specified.

Components used:

    -TM4C123G LaunchPad.

    -NEO 6M GPS module.

How it works:

    -The GPS subsystem stores the coordinates of the start point. 

    -The destination point is entered into the program as coordinates.

    -After reaching the destination point, the GPS subsystem stores the coordinates of the end point and calculates the total distance that was taken by the user.
